## Question 1: 
Write a program that generates and prints 50 random integers, each between 3 and 6.
## Question 2: 
Write a program that generates a random number, x, between 1 and 50, a random number y between 2 and 5, and computes x raise to power y .
## Question 3: 
Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and prints your name that many times.
## Question 4: 
Write a program that generates a random decimal number between 1 and 10 with two decimal places of accuracy. Examples are 1.23, 3.45, 9.80, and 5.00.
## Question 5: 
Write a program that generates 50 random numbers such that the first number is between 1 and 2, the second is between 1 and 3, the third is between 1 and 4, . . . , and the last is between 1 and 51.
## Question 6: 
Write a program that asks the user to enter a length in centimeters. If the user enters a negative length, the program should tell the user that the entry is invalid. Otherwise, the program should convert the length to inches and print out the result. There are 2.54 centimeters in an inch.
## Question 7: 
Write a program that asks the user how many credits they have taken. If they have taken 23 or less, print that the student is a freshman. If they have taken between 24 and 53, print that they are a sophomore. The range for juniors is 54 to 83, and for seniors it is 84 and over.
## Question 8: 
Generate a random number between 1 and 10. Ask the user to guess the number and print a message based on whether they get it right or not.
## Question 9: 
Write a multiplication game program for kids. The program should give the player ten randomly generated multiplication questions to do. After each, the program should tell them whether they got it right or wrong and what the correct answer is.
## Question 11

Write a program that asks the user to enter a list of integers. Do the following:

**(a)** Print the total number of items in the list.  
**(b)** Print the last item in the list.  
**(c)** Print the list in reverse order.  
**(d)** Print **Yes** if the list contains a `5` and **No** otherwise.  
**(e)** Print the number of fives in the list.  
**(f)** Remove the first and last items from the list, sort the remaining items, and print the result.

## Question 12

Start with the list [8,9,10]. Do the following:

**(a)** Set the second entry (index 1) to 17.
**(b)** Add 4, 5, and 6 to the end of the list.
**(c)** Remove the first entry from the list.
**(d)** Sort the list.
**(e)** Double the list.
**(f)** Insert 25 at index 3.
The final list should equal [4,5,6,25,10,17,4,5,6,10,17].
